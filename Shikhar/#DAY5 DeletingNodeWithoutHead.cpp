// LeetCode Problem 237

// There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.

// You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.

// All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not the last node in the linked list.

// Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

// The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
// The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
// All the values before node should be in the same order.
// All the values after node should be in the same order.
